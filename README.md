Memozie! is a memory card game app I built while doing a Stanford online course, following a SwiftUI tutorial and adding my own features. The game allows users to pick different themes—emojis, animals, and sports—with each theme changing the card colors. A random number of card pairs appears each time a new theme is chosen, making every round different.

I added interactive card-flipping functionality, so players can reveal and hide the card contents with a tap. The app uses a dynamic grid layout to adapt to any screen size.

This project marks my second-ever portfolio piece and reflects my progress in learning iOS development. Feel free to check it out or contribute if you'd like!
